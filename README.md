# flutter-beamer-backend
Repository for the back-end server for the Take-Home qualification task for GSoC 2021 for CCExtractor Flutter team. 

This is the back-end used for the [Beamer](https://github.com/Piero512/flutter-beamer) app.

Currently it has some strategies for keeping and sharing the location data, but uses MemoryBackend because it's a proof of context.
You may write newer backend by following the interface.
